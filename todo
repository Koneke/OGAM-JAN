Implement already designed screen editor
Drawing tiled quads (like, if we want to fill a large area with the same tile, minimize the amount of draw calls)
Switching screen (level, room, whatever)
Save TextDrawCalls from renderString in Text object, and only render if none is saved
Render to texture (e.g. like parts of the screen we know won't change)
Map class relations and usage for structure overview, clean up, merge etc.
Clean up context menus
Sound panning
tilesheet into .thl
multitilesheet screens
nontexture graphics for frame
frame.getShape
more graceful crashing in general (catch more exceptions, you dummy)
loopable sounds

Done:
Switch to new text rendering in the context menus (remove the textSheet)
Coloured text (not restricted to text)
Check box gui
Entity file format
Rework getting graphics from entities
Audio file listing file
Finish radio gui elements
Load screens from file
Globalize scale variable instead of passing it all the time
mapsize, tilesize into .thl
Non-alphabetical character font support
Console (not java console, ingame text, top left) write function (small, but saves repetition)
coloured console text
