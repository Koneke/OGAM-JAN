Implement already designed screen editor
Drawing tiled quads (like, if we want to fill a large area with the same tile, minimize the amount of draw calls)
Save TextDrawCalls from renderString in Text object, and only render if none is saved
Render to texture (e.g. like parts of the screen we know won't change)
Map class relations and usage for structure overview, clean up, merge etc.
Clean up context menus
Sound panning
Tilesheet into .thl
Multitilesheet screens
Mouse wheel clicking
Partially invisible entity names (like an unique id at the end)
Adding entities

Done:
Switch to new text rendering in the context menus (remove the textSheet)
Coloured text (not restricted to text)
Check box gui
Entity file format
Rework getting graphics from entities
Audio file listing file
Finish radio gui elements
Load screens from file
Globalize scale variable instead of passing it all the time
Mapsize, tilesize into .thl
Non-alphabetical character font support
Console (not java console, ingame text, top left) write function (small, but saves repetition)
Coloured console text
Loopable sounds
More graceful crashing in general (catch more exceptions, you dummy)
Nontexture graphics for frame
Frame.getShape
Basic screen switching
Removing entities
Animation play count (can be used for one shots and stuff)
